# Swift Notes Playground
This is a collection of notes taken from my Swift learnings.

Consists of notes for all topics from the [Swift documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/). The playground files cover each topic with detailed examples and explanations.
